üìö Exercise 2: ARIA Roles in Semantic Elements üìö

üö® For this exercise, you must use your system
üö® screen reader. Please follow the below tutorials
üö® to set up your computer's screen reader.
üö®   ChromeOS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpbIsN31hLM&
üö®   macOS:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R-6WvAihms
üö®   Windows:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiQ8NwdsZCY
üö® Each screen reader is a little different based on the OS.
üö® Make sure you're watching the right video
üö® based on your OS.

Welcome to Exercise 2: ARIA Roles in Semantic Elements! 

ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) Roles
provide contextual information about HTML elements
on a page that may be clear to a reader visually,
but may not be well defined when being understood
by accessible technology.

Many HTML elements have ARIA roles built into them.
This includes elements like h2, p, ul, nav, and more.

You may have noticed that you can't see anything
in the Exercise 2 page! You can only use a screen reader
to browse this page and see its content. Without ARIA
roles, you don't have any meaningful understanding of
content on the page, and it makes it difficult for you,
and people who use screen reading technology, to
interact with or understand a page.

To see just how meaningful ARIA roles are, use your
screen reader on the Exercise 2 page. Compare what
the screen reader can understand with what you as a
visual reader can see on Exercise 1. There should
be a huge discrepancy between what you can intuit
visually and what the screen reader can understand,
based solely on semantic elements
If your website depends solely on one sense to be 
able to use it, it is inherently inaccessible.

üõ†Ô∏è Replace div and span elements with their 
üõ†Ô∏è semantically meaningful counterparts
üõ†Ô∏è (header, paragraph, section, list, etc.)
üõ†Ô∏è You only have system audio and your keyboard to navigate the page.

üí° You should not need to modify or add any CSS.
üí° Listen to your screen reader as you navigate
üí° the page. As you change elements to their
üí° semantically meaningful counterparts, you
üí° should hear things like "Heading", "List",
üí° and "Button" be described by your screen reader.

  Now that you've added more semantic elements
  to the page, try adding ?lightsOn=true to
  the end of the URL bar to see how the page
  looks _visually_. Notice any differences?
